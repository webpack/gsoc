# Writing a Strong GSoC Proposal

A good Google Summer of Code proposal tells a clear story: what problem you'll solve, how you'll solve it, and why you're the right person to do it. This guide will help you write a proposal that stands out.

## What Makes a Good Proposal

**Clear problem description** - Show you understand a real issue that webpack users face.

**Thoughtful solution** - Demonstrate you've researched the problem and have a realistic approach.

**Proven ability** - Your contributions to webpack prove you can work with the codebase.

**Realistic timeline** - Break down the work into achievable milestones with buffer time.

**Personal motivation** - Explain why this project matters to you and the webpack community.

## Before You Write

### Make Contributions First

GSoC applications **require** at least one merged contribution to webpack. This isn't just a checkbox - it helps you understand how webpack works and proves you can contribute effectively.

Start with these repositories:
- [webpack/webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) - Core functionality
- [webpack/webpack-cli](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-cli) - Command line interface
- [webpack/webpack.js.org](https://github.com/webpack/webpack.js.org) - Documentation

Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`.

### Understand webpack Deeply

Before proposing changes, make sure you understand:

- How webpack's [compilation process](webpack-architecture.md) works
- The [plugin system](technical-guides/plugin-system.md) and how extensions work
- Current webpack [issues and pain points](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues)
- What the community is discussing on [Discord](https://discord.gg/PebpZRPfJp)

### Study the Project Ideas

Review our [project ideas list](project-ideas.md) for inspiration, but don't limit yourself to these suggestions. The best proposals often come from contributors who've identified problems through their own experience.

## Proposal Structure

### 1. Title and Problem (1-2 paragraphs)

Start with a clear title and explain the specific problem you're solving:
- What challenge do webpack users face?
- Why is this important to the community?
- How does this align with webpack's goals?

### 2. Your Solution (2-3 paragraphs)

Describe your approach clearly:
- What will you build?
- How will it work technically?
- Why is this the best approach?

### 3. Timeline (3-4 milestones)

Break your 12-week project into clear phases:
- **Weeks 1-3**: Research and design
- **Weeks 4-6**: Core implementation
- **Weeks 7-9**: Integration and testing
- **Weeks 10-12**: Polish and documentation

Include specific deliverables for each phase.

### 4. Your Background (1 paragraph)

Show you can deliver:
- Your webpack contributions so far
- Relevant technical experience
- Why this project interests you

### 5. Post-GSoC Commitment (1 paragraph)

Explain how you'll maintain the feature after GSoC ends.

## Writing Tips

**Be specific** - "Improve build performance by 25% for large projects" instead of "make webpack faster"

**Show your work** - Link to your contributions and reference specific webpack issues

**Write clearly** - Your reviewers are busy. Make it easy to understand your proposal

**Stay focused** - A clear 3-page proposal beats a rambling 10-page one

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Unrealistic scope** - GSoC is 12 weeks. Be honest about what's achievable.

**No prior contributions** - Make meaningful contributions before applying.

**Vague technical details** - Show you understand the implementation challenges.

**Ignoring the community** - Engage with webpack developers and users.

## Evaluation Criteria

Proposals are evaluated on:
- **Technical merit** (40%) - Is the solution well-researched?
- **Your capability** (30%) - Can you execute based on your contributions?
- **Project value** (20%) - Will this help webpack users?
- **Proposal quality** (10%) - Is it well-written and clear?

## Getting Help

**Ask early** - Don't wait until deadline to ask questions

**Share drafts** - Get feedback from mentors and community

**Stay engaged** - Keep contributing while your proposal is reviewed

## Final Checklist

Before submitting:
- [ ] Clear problem statement with examples
- [ ] Realistic 12-week timeline
- [ ] Links to your webpack contributions
- [ ] Evidence of community engagement
- [ ] Professional writing and grammar

## Resources

- [Past successful proposals](https://medium.com/webpack/gsoc-2020-with-webpack-6ad0a30bcaac)
