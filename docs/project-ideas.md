# webpack GSoC Project Ideas

This document outlines key project ideas for Google Summer of Code with webpack. These projects represent high-impact opportunities to improve webpack for millions of developers worldwide.

> **Note**: These are carefully selected suggestions based on webpack's current priorities. You're also welcome to propose your own ideas that align with webpack's goals and community needs.

## ðŸŽ¯ How to Choose a Project

**Match your skills** with project requirements and **consider your interests** - passion drives success. Each project should fit the GSoC timeline (12 weeks) and have clear deliverables.

**Before proposing**: Make contributions to webpack, engage with the community, and deeply understand the problem you want to solve.

## ðŸš€ Performance & Optimization

### Enhanced Bundle Analysis and Visualization

**Difficulty**: Medium | **Skills**: JavaScript, Data Visualization, Performance Analysis

**The Problem**: webpack-bundle-analyzer is widely used but lacks advanced analysis capabilities. Developers need better insights into bundle composition and optimization opportunities.

**Your Solution Could Include**:
- Advanced bundle analysis algorithms for detecting duplicates and inefficiencies
- Interactive dependency graph visualizations
- Automated recommendations for optimization opportunities
- Performance impact prediction for different bundling strategies

**Impact**: Help developers reduce bundle sizes and optimize application performance.

### Build Performance Profiler

**Difficulty**: Medium-Hard | **Skills**: Node.js, Performance Analysis, CLI Tools

**The Problem**: Large webpack builds can be slow, but developers lack detailed insights into where time is spent during compilation.

**Your Solution Could Include**:
- Comprehensive build performance profiler with phase-by-phase timing
- Memory usage tracking and leak detection
- Automated optimization recommendations
- Integration with existing build tools and CI systems

**Impact**: Significantly improve webpack build times for large applications.

### Advanced Tree Shaking

**Difficulty**: Hard | **Skills**: JavaScript, AST Analysis, Module Systems

**The Problem**: webpack's tree shaking could eliminate more unused code, especially in complex scenarios like method chaining and dynamic imports.

**Your Solution Could Include**:
- Enhanced detection of unused code patterns
- Improved side-effect analysis for complex modules
- Cross-module dead code elimination
- Better support for modern ECMAScript features

**Impact**: Reduce bundle sizes by eliminating more unused code automatically.

## ðŸ”§ Developer Experience

### Better Error Messages and Debugging

**Difficulty**: Medium | **Skills**: JavaScript, CLI Design, Error Handling

**The Problem**: webpack's error messages can be confusing, especially for beginners. Better error reporting would improve the developer experience significantly.

**Your Solution Could Include**:
- Clear, actionable error messages with context
- Interactive error resolution with suggested fixes
- Educational explanations linked to documentation
- Better stack traces and debugging information

**Impact**: Make webpack more accessible to new developers and reduce debugging time.

### Hot Module Replacement Enhancements

**Difficulty**: Medium-Hard | **Skills**: JavaScript, WebSockets, Module Systems

**The Problem**: Hot Module Replacement (HMR) can be unreliable in complex applications, leading to full page reloads that slow development.

**Your Solution Could Include**:
- Improved HMR reliability and error recovery
- Support for more module types and frameworks
- Better debugging tools for HMR issues
- Intelligent fallback strategies

**Impact**: Faster development cycles with more reliable hot reloading.

---

### Interactive Configuration Assistant

**Difficulty**: Medium | **Skills**: JavaScript, CLI Tools, Configuration Management

**The Problem**: webpack configuration can be overwhelming for newcomers, creating a barrier to adoption.

**Your Solution Could Include**:
- Interactive configuration wizard with smart defaults
- Best practice recommendations based on project type
- Configuration validation with helpful suggestions
- Migration tools for webpack updates

**Impact**: Lower the entry barrier for new webpack users.

## ðŸ“¦ Modern JavaScript Support

### Enhanced ES Module Support

**Difficulty**: Medium-Hard | **Skills**: JavaScript, Module Systems, Node.js

**The Problem**: As the JavaScript ecosystem adopts ES modules, webpack needs better support for modern module patterns and Node.js interoperability.

**Your Solution Could Include**:
- Improved ES module and CommonJS interoperability
- Better support for dynamic imports and top-level await
- Enhanced module resolution for ES modules
- Node.js ES module compatibility improvements

**Impact**: Better support for modern JavaScript applications and libraries.

---

### Modern Web Platform Integration

**Difficulty**: Medium | **Skills**: JavaScript, Web APIs, Browser Technologies

**The Problem**: webpack should better support modern web platform features like Web Components, Import Maps, and Progressive Web App capabilities.

**Your Solution Could Include**:
- Native Web Components support and optimization
- Import Maps integration for better module loading
- Enhanced Service Worker and PWA build capabilities
- Integration with modern browser APIs

**Impact**: Enable developers to build modern web applications more easily.
